# Learning Rust by going through Advent of Code 2022
In this repository I will be going through the Advent of Code 2022 challenges in Rust. I will be using this as a way to learn Rust and to get more familiar with the language.

Each day will have its own folder with the input file and the solution file. For now, I will be using the `main.rs` file for each day, but I will probably change this later on.
